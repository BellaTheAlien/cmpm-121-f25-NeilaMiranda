Section activity for 10/1/2025, Edited by Neila Miranda:
Intended to introduce many of the tools and workflows that will be use in CMPM 121.

The project is to make the counter update in the console log, however there is not chnage in the page visually and the counter stays the same.

Bellow are some of the key tools and workflows for me to refrence later:

Key tools:

- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), a cloud-based development environment based [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that runs in your web browser.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), a CI/CD service that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a static site hosting service that allows you to publish web content for free.

Key workflows:

- Forking a project template repository to create your own copy.
- Configuring your repository to enable deployment automation (GitHub Actions) (deployment automation) and publishing (GitHub Pages).
- Accessing that repository using your IDE (Codespaces or local VS Code).
- Launching a local development server to preview your project in a web browser.
- Making a small change to the project.
- Manually testing your change locally.
- Committing and pushing your change to your remote repository on GitHub, verifying that the deployment succeeds.
- Removing this introductory documentation and replacing it with your own so that your project represents your voice, not that of the course staff. (Students: Don't let _this_ README.md be the only documentation in your project!)
- Repeating the editing-to-publishing process to build familiarity with the overall workflow.
